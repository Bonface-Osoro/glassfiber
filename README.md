# A global assessment of fixed broadband infrastructure (glassfibre)
Broadband infrastructure consists of all electronic and non-electronic assets operated to provide broadband services to users. Indeed, investing in universal broadband infrastructure is essential for Internet adoption and is a key part of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals via Target 9.1 (United Nations 2019). The availability of Internet connectivity can provide new economic opportunities for unconnected communities and help in fostering greater structural shifts in labor markets towards more productive, digitally-enabled activities (Jung and López-Bazo, 2020). Moreover, Internet-enabled online services are increasingly essential for economic development, with the literature documenting improved educational outcomes, enhanced healthcare, economic productivity benefits, and job creation (Czernich et. al. 2011; Ford and Koutsky 2005; Gallardo et. al. 2020; Koutroumpis 2019; Prieger 2013; Tranos and Mack 2015; Brian Whitacre et. al. 2014).
While the large disparity in broadband connectivity is a longstanding problem caused by many factors (e.g., availability, affordability, relevance, skills etc.), this issue has been made highly evident during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, placing broadband infrastructure at the center of economic policy agendas can unlock economic opportunities, create jobs, and generate growth as well as improve the quality of life of citizens (Briglauer et. al. 2021; Prado and Bauer 2021; Simione and Li 2021; Strover et. al. 2021).
